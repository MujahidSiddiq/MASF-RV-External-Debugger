## 1. Project Goals

The project focuses on implementing critical debugging operations that help developers manage and inspect RISC-V processors during code execution. The core features targeted for this project are:

- **Halt**: Pause the processor at any point in execution.
- **Resume**: Continue execution from a halted state.
- **Step**: Execute one instruction at a time for granular control.
- **Software Breakpoints**: Dynamically insert breakpoints during execution.
- **Hardware Breakpoints**: Utilize hardware support for memory-specific breakpoints.
- **Memory Access**: Inspect and modify memory during runtime.
- **Register Access**: Inspect and modify the CSRs.

-_More features can be added as per project requirements._

## 2. Implemented Features

Currently, the following debugging features have been successfully integrated into the **Debug Module (DM)** and **Hart**:

- **Halt**: The processor can be paused and controlled by the debugger.
- **Step**: Instruction-level debugging is enabled, allowing step-by-step code execution.
- **Resume**: Execution resumes seamlessly from a halted state.

## 3. Block Diagram

The block diagram below showcases the interaction between the **Debug Module (DM)** and the **Hart** during halt, step, and resume operations:

## 4. State Machines

- ### 4.1 Debug Module State Machine

  The main states are:

  - **Non-Debug States**: DM is waiting for a halt request.
  - **Halt/Resume**: These states are using for Halting and Resuming. Also use for executing next instruction in stepping mode.
  - **Access Register Abstract Command**: These states are using for access registers with abstract command (like we use to access dcsr register for stepping).

- ### 4.2 Hart State Machine

  The main states are:

  - **Non-Debug States**: DM is waiting for a halt request.
  - **Halt/Resume**: These states are using for Halting to enter in Debug Mode, and Resuming.
  - **Step**: These states are responsible for single step execution in Debug Mode.

## 5. Simulation Results

We have made significant advancements in the implementation of halt, stepping, and resuming functionality in both the **Debug Module (DM)** and **Hart**. Below is a summary of our simulation results:

1. **Halt Request**: Setting the `haltreq` in `dmcontrol` successfully transitioned the Hart to a halted state and into Debug Mode, as anticipated.

2. **Stepping Mode**: By setting the step bit in the `dcsr` register (via `data0` and the Command register), our simulation confirmed that the Hart entered stepping mode, with the first instruction executing correctly. This was accomplished without a physical connection to the processor, relying solely on our logical implementation.

3. **Resuming with Stepping**: When `resumereq` was activated, stepping occurred (since the step bit remained set), allowing continuous resume commands to enable the Hart to step through each instruction one by one successfully.

4. **Exiting Stepping Mode**: After clearing the step bit in the `dcsr` register, we verified that the Hart exited stepping mode.

5. **Resuming the Processor**: After setting `resumereq` in `dmcontrol`, the Hart resumed normal execution and exited Debug Mode. Our simulation confirmed that the processor continued executing instructions without issues.

Overall, the simulation is functioning as intended, aligning perfectly with the described flow.

## 6. Challenges Faced

During the development of **MASF-RV-External-Debugger**, we identified some problems in the **Debug Module (DM)**, especially with how it interacts with the **Debug Module Interface (DMI)**. These issues will be fixed in the future after the completion of the DM functionality:

- **DMI Response Handling**: The **DM** currently doesnâ€™t have a proper controller to manage DMI response ports, which can lead to unpredictable behavior. A dedicated controller will be added to ensure correct response handling.

- **DMI Request Handling**: Right now, **DMI requests** are handled using combinational logic, which may cause bugs when DMI inputs change. We plan to implement a state machine for DMI requests to ensure more reliable and consistent operation.

Once these issues are resolved, it will improve the DM functionality and allow us to add more debugging features.
